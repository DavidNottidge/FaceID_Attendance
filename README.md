# FaceID_Attendance
this code uses opencv and python's face recognition library to identify faces and store them in a csv file along with the date and time of capture
I'd advice you run it on anaconda and use the anaconda prompt to install the necessary libraries using conda install, python's face recongnition library has dependencies
in cmake and dlib so DO WELL TO INSTALL CMAKE AND DLIB before installing the face recognition library
